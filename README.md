# phase-0.5-hardware-and-system-architecture

This repository documents a structured deep dive into computer hardware and system architecture, focusing on the physical components that allow software to run.

The goal of this phase was to understand how core hardware components work, how they communicate, and how the system starts and loads an operating system.

This phase builds directly on the digital and system foundations established in Phase 0 and prepares the foundation for operating systems.

## Topics Covered

What Is a Computer (Hardware Perspective)  
CPU (The Brain)  
Memory (Short-Term / RAM)  
Storage (Long-Term: HDD, SSD, NVMe)  
Motherboard (The Backbone)  
GPU (Graphics and Parallel Processing)  
Power and Cooling  
Input and Output Devices  
Ports, Cables, and Interfaces  
Firmware and Boot Process (BIOS vs UEFI, POST, Bootloader)  
Hardware Performance and Bottlenecks  
Desktop vs Laptop vs Server Hardware  
Hardware Failure and Troubleshooting (Introduction)  

## What This Phase Covers

This phase builds understanding of:

Computer hardware architecture and system design  
CPU instruction execution and system control  
Memory systems and how RAM supports program execution  
Storage technologies and permanent data persistence  
Motherboard structure and hardware communication pathways  
GPU architecture and parallel computation  
Power delivery and thermal management  
Input/output devices and user interaction with systems  
Hardware interfaces and component communication  
Firmware responsibilities and the boot process  
Hardware performance limitations and bottlenecks  
Differences between desktop, laptop, and server design tradeoffs  
Common failure modes and basic troubleshooting concepts  

The objective is to understand the physical system that runs software before studying how the operating system manages hardware and runs programs.

## Status

Phase 0.5 Completed.
